- Whitepaper: https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf
- N * Commodity machines
- Break files into chunks of: 16-256 MB (splits)
- 1 Master - N Workers
- Master keeps track of process of each Split (Which worker owns it, What's status)
- Worker gets data directly from source not through Master (reduce load for master)
- Worker processes data, store in RAM (fast), flush to disk, (may flush to distributed storage)
- E.g: slit 2D matrix, gg search
- Fault tolerance
  - Worker fails
    - How master knows work fails? Heartbeat
    - Scenarios:
      - Split A: Not completed -> Reassign to another worker
      - Split B: Completed but not yet flushed to Distributed storage -> Reassign to another worker
      - Split C: Completed and ALREADY pushed to Distributed storage -> N/A
  - Master fails: backup master (not mentioned in whitepaper)
- Output (stored in distributed storage)
  - #chunkFiles === #splits
- Improvements
  - Keeps data near processing workers (geographic location)
