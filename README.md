- N * Commodity machines
- Break files into chunks of: 16-256 MB (splits)
- 1 Master - N Workers
- Master keeps track of process of each Split (Which worker owns it, What's status)
- Worker gets data directly from source not through Master (reduce load for master)
- Worker processes data, keeps locally, and flush to distributed storage
- TODO: Fault tolerance
